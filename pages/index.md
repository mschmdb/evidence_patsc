# Welcome to Evidence! ðŸ‘‹
Build a polished business intelligence system using only SQL & Markdown.

# Write Markdown
Evidence creates pages from markdown files. The file for this page is:

`[my-project]/pages/index.md`.

ðŸ‘‰ Open this file, change some text and save it to see this page update instantly.

# Connect to a Database
ðŸ‘‰ Connect to a database in the **Settings** menu. For this tutorial, choose a **SQLite** database and enter the filename `needful_things`. 

![Connecting a database](connect-db.gif)

# Run SQL
Write queries using markdown code fences ` ``` `:

```orders_by_month
select
Country,
sum(Filing_Fee) as Filing_Fee
from Mappe2_Tabelle1
group by 1
order by 2 desc

```

You can see both the SQL and the query results by interacting with the query above.

ðŸ‘‰ Edit the above query to just display 2021 data by adding:

`where order_datetime >= '2021-01-01'`

# Include Values in Text
Return values from queries in text: 

Last month customers placed <Value data={orders_by_month} column=Filing_Fee/> orders.

Sometimes you need something *bigger*: 
<BigValue data={orders_by_month} value=Filing_Fee />

ðŸ‘‰ Add another `<BigValue/>` above showing `average_order_value_usd2`.

# Add Charts & Components
Charts can be included in a single line of code:

<BarChart data = {orders_by_month} y=Filing_Fee title = 'Sales by Month, USD' />

ðŸ‘‰ Change the chart to a `LineChart`.

# Use More Powerful Features âš¡
Evidence supports using logic & loops to determine what text and data is displayed.
